# Statecharts

This project offers two variants of Statechart Languages [UMLStatecharts](UMLStatecharts.mc4) and 
[TriggeredStatecharts](TriggeredStatecharts.mc4) both of which are based on several provided 
language components that offer the different features for Statecharts. These components are:
- [SCBasis](SCBasis.mc4),
- [SCStateHierarchy](SCStateHierarchy.mc4),
- [SCStateInvariants](SCStateInvariants.mc4),
- [SCActions](SCActions.mc4),
- [SCDoActions](SCDoActions.mc4),
- [SCTransitions4Code](SCTransitions4Code.mc4),
- [SCTransitions4Modelling](SCTransitions4Modelling.mc4), and
- [SCCompleteness](SCCompleteness.mc4)

## Syntax

A small for the UML Statecharts language:

```
statechart Door {
  state Opened;
  initial state Closed;
  state Locked;

  Opened -> Closed  close() ;
  Closed -> Opened  open() / { count++; ringTheDoorBell(); };
  Closed -> Locked  timeOut() / lockDoor() ;
  Locked -> Closed  [isAuthorized() && keyFits()] unlock() ;
}

```
This example models the three states of a door: `Opened`, `Closed`, and `Locked`
and four transitions (each terminated by `;`).
- States may be marked with `initial` and `final`.
- A transition is defined by `source -> target` states,
  a stimulus, such as a method call `close()`,
  a trigger condition `[...]`, and an action `/ ...`.
- Expressions can be used for conditions, and statements respectively blocks `{...}` 
  for the actions.

Further extensions are shown in the following, where 
`XXX` has two substates as well as entry, exit actions and and invariant:
```
 XXX TODO 
```

Expressions and statements can be taken from MontiCores basic grammar libary 
and extended by any own interesting language constructs (such as sending/receiving 
messages `!m` or `?m`)

 ## UMLStatecharts

 This language combines the language components `SCActions`, `SCDoActions`, `SCStateHierarchy`, 
 `SCStateInvariants`, `SCCompleteness`, `SCTransitions4Modelling`, `CommonExpressions` and
 `MCCommonStatements`. Thus, it allows modeling UML-like Statechart with hierarchical states that 
 may have entry, do and exit actions as well as invariants. Furthermore, transitions with pre- 
 and postconditions, events and actions are possible. The  statechart itself as well as states 
 can be marked as complete. The teaser above conforms to this language.
 
 ## TriggeredStatecharts
 
 `TriggeredStatecharts` is a second combination of the basic language components. 
 It combines the 
 language components `SCActions`, `SCStateHierarchy`, `SCTransitions4Code`, `CommonExpressions and 
 `MCCommonStatements`. Thus, it allows modeling Statecharts with hierarchical states that may 
 have entry and exit actions.
 
 On the oone hand, `TriggeredStatecharts` show how flexible the language component library
 is and how easy individual languages can be designed.
 
 On the other hand, `TriggeredStatecharts` have their own dedicated use for descriptions
 in the embedded area, where a softwar ecomponent is often *triggered* 
 on a regular basis (i.e. with a certain periodic repetition and signals do not
 arrive as events, but as avaliable values). We also designed `TriggeredStatecharts`
 as implementation oriented language, and therfore do not add specification oriented constructs:
 - no do actions 
 - no state invariants
 - transitions consist of a precondition an event and an action.
 TODO: ist das so, dass die f√ºr MA sinnvollen transitionen ein "event" haben?

 
 ## SCBasis
SCBasis is the basic grammar component for automata. It defines
a Statechart structure including package 
and imports as well as the Statechart nonterminal itself. 
Inside a Statechart the `SCArtifact` extension point allows to add various forms
of states and transitions (or other constructs).
Furthermore, states and transitions 
with extension points for their bodies (`SCSBody` and `SCTBody`) are provided.
