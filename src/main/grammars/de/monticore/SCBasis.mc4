/**
 *  This is the basis language component for Statecharts.
 *
 *  It provides states and (intern) transitions along with extension points
 *  for state and statechart elements, state and transition bodies.
 *
 *  Furthermore, it introduces but not directly uses the SCCondition
 *  meant to be used for pre-/post-conditions and invariants.
 *
 *  It uses
 *     * ExpressionsBasis for conditions
 *     * MCBasicTypes for the import statement and
 *     * UMLStereotype for the stereotype
 *     Expression and Literal are imported extension points
 *     that shall be filled in concrete, complete languages
 *     by a variety of available grammars.
 *
 *  This grammar is part of a hierarchy of Statechart components, namely
 *  * SCBasis.mc4
 *  * ^- SCActions.mc4
 *  *    ^- SCDoActions.mc4
 *  *    ^- SCTransitions4Code.mc4
 *  *    ^- SCTransitions4Modelling.mc4
 *  * ^- SCCompleteness.mc4
 *  * ^- SCStateHierarchy.mc4
 *  *    ^- SCStateInvariants.mc4
 *  and two alternative grammars composing most of it:
 *  * UMLStatecharts.mc4 (based on Events)
 *  * TriggeredStatecharts.mc4 (based on regular triggers and Port-Values)
 *
 * Relevant extension points:
 *    SCSBody:
 *           e.g. for hierachical states
 *    SCStateElement
 *           e.g. for entry/exit/do actions
 *    SCTBody
 *           e.g. for the desired form of transition body
 *           (is currently empty and must be filled)
 *
 * if needed add in your own extending grammar:
 *   nokeyword "initial", "final", "state";
